-----------------------------Oriented object programming-----------------------------------

- Class.

A class is a group of functions and properties that have similar caracteristics.

	A class can be initialized by:

		class Name_of_my_class{
			//here are the properties and methods of the class	
		}

- Object.

An object is an instance of a class.
A class can isntance one or many different objects with different properties and functions

	An object can be created by:

		$obj = new Name_of_my_class;

	NOTE: As you can see the object is instanced by the class "Name_of_myclass" that we created previously

- Properties.

Properties are those atributes that an object could have. For instance: If we set a car as an object, its properties are the color, model, number of doors and so on.

	Properties are set by the following sintax:

		public $name_of_my_property1 = [the_value_of_my_property1];

	NOTE: The "public" keyword makes reference to the visibility of the the property.

	- Calling a property by an object.

		$obj->name_of_my_property;

	NOTE: In case that there is a need on using a property inside the same class you call it using the keyword "$this" instead "$obj" which is our previously created object. This is because all objects should be instanced outside of te class.

- Methods or functions.

Methods of functions are those operations that need to be applied in a program.

	- Creating a function.

		public function My_function(){
			//operation of my fucntion
		}

	- Calling a function from an object.

		$obj->My_function();
