-----------------------------Oriented object programming-----------------------------------

- Class.

A class is a group of functions and properties that have similar caracteristics.

	A class can be initialized by:

		class Name_of_my_class{
			//here are the properties and methods of the class	
		}

- Object.

An object is an instance of a class.
A class can isntance one or many different objects with different properties and functions

	An object can be created by:

		$obj = new Name_of_my_class;

	NOTE: As you can see the object is instanced by the class "Name_of_myclass" that we created previously

- Properties.

Properties are those atributes that an object could have. For instance: If we set a car as an object, its properties are the color, model, number of doors and so on.

	Properties are set by the following sintax:

		public $name_of_my_property1 = [the_value_of_my_property1];

	NOTE: The "public" keyword makes reference to the visibility of the the property.

	- Calling a property by an object.

		$obj->name_of_my_property;

	NOTE: In case that there is a need on using a property inside the same class you call it using the keyword "$this" instead "$obj" which is our previously created object. This is because all objects should be instanced outside of te class.

- Methods or functions.

Methods of functions are those operations that need to be applied in a program.

	- Creating a function.

		public function My_function(){
			//operation of my fucntion
		}

	- Calling a function from an object.

		$obj->My_function();

- Special methods or magic methods

	- Construct:

		This method is special because is automatically trigged everytime that an object is instanced.

		The sintaxis to create this method is:

			public function __construct(){
				//Here you can set instructions that you want to execute
			}

	- Destruct:

		This method is trigged once the object is destroyed and is useful for closing prosess

		The sintaxis to create this method is:

			public function __destruct(){
				//Here you can set instructions that you want to execute one an object is destroyed
			}

	- Unset:

		Normally an object is destroyed once all script is run. This method allow us to destroy an object before the whole script is completely run.

		This means that if we set a __destruct() method before, it will be trigget as soon as unset() is executed.

		The sintax for this method is:

			unset($obj);

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inheritance

	Inheritance is the ability of a class to use, overwrite and add properties or methods from a parent class.

	To inherit a class from a parent we use the keyword "extends"

	Creating an inherited class ("MyNewClass") which inherit methods and properties from a parent class called "MyParentClass":

		class MyNewClass extends MyParentClass{
			//methods and properties go here
			//This class can call properties and methods from the class MyParentClass
		}

	NOTE: In this case we asume that a parent class (MyParentClass) was created previously and has its own metods and properties that are aviable to use with an extended class ("MyNewClass")
